<b>Me and my team participated in the 2016 Yhack (annual intercollegiate Hackathon held by Yale University) and made a web app called "Let's Roll" using ARCGIS rest api. The app uses Esri's powerful geolocation and mapping services to cater special routing needs for people with disabilities.</b>


<b>The app uses parts of the framework code from Ben Lawson[https://github.com/benlawson]
